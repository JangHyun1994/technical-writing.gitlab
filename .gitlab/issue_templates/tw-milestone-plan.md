This issue provides a consolidated view of what the Technical Writing team expects to work on with their assigned groups for the upcoming milestone. In addition to the work with their assigned groups, the [Technical Writing team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/technical-writing/) also works on [OKRs](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/#okrs) and other tasks that are not reflected in this issue.

**On the `15th` of each month:**

The [TW Bot](https://gitlab.com/project_10614162_bot) creates the issue for the upcoming milestone.

**By the `29th` of each month:**

The TW carries out [planning activities](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/technical-writing/workflow/#planning) for their assigned groups, and populates [Checklist and links](#checklist-and-links) to confirm these activities have taken place:

1. Have a conversation - synchronously or asynchronously - with either the group **PM** or **EM** to review planned ~"documentation" and ~"UI text" work for the upcoming milestone (`Milestone: Upcoming`) or (`Milestone: Started`). This is also an opportunity to talk to the PM or EM about any improvement or development opportunities they're aware of in their areas of the product documentation. This can be a regular group meeting or any other means of communication that you have established with your group.

   If the TW, PM, or EM is unavailable around the beginning of the milestone, we encourage using async methods (like commenting in issues or Slack messages) or having conversations at an earlier time. If the conversation happens before the creation of the issue, just add the planning information to the issue when it's available.

1. Identify a linked artifact that describes the upcoming planned work, such as:
   - An issue board for the group's documentation/UI text items for the milestone.
   - A filter that describes/lists the planned work. ([Example](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/3168664?scope=all&label_name[]=documentation&milestone_title=%23upcoming) for ~"devops::plan")
   - The group's planning issue, if it identifies issues/MRs that require Technical Writing team involvement. ([Example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/pipeline-authoring/-/issues/30))

1. Select the appropriate checkboxes and share the links to planned features to confirm that the "conversation" has taken place.

## Checklist and links

After you've reviewed the plan with your PM or EM, select the checkbox for your group. If you can't meet with the PM or EM for some reason (perhaps they're on PTO), append that information to the end of the line and leave the checkbox cleared.
