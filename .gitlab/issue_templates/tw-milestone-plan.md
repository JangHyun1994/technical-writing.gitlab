# Technical Writing milestone plan for: xx.x

This issue provides a consolidated view of what the Technical Writing team expects to work on with their assigned groups for the upcoming milestone.

**By the `22nd` of each month:**

One of the TW Managers creates the issue for the upcoming milestone.

**By the `29th` of each month:**

The TW carries out the following planning activities for their assigned groups, and populates [Checklist and links](#checklist-and-links) to confirm these activities have taken place:

1. Have a conversation - synchronously or asynchronously - with either the group **PM** or **EM** about planned ~"documentation" and ~"UI text" work for the upcoming milestone (`Milestone: Upcoming`) or (`Milestone: Started`). This is also an opportunity to talk to the PM or EM about any improvement or development opportunities they're aware of in their areas of the product documentation. This can be a regular group meeting or any other means of communication that you have established with your group.

1. Identify a linked artifact that describes the upcoming planned work, such as:
   - An issue board for the group's documentation/UI text items for the milestone.
   - A filter that describes/lists the planned work. ([Example](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/3168664?scope=all&label_name[]=documentation&milestone_title=%23upcoming) for ~"devops::plan")
   - The group's planning issue, if it identifies issues/MRs that require Technical Writing team involvement. ([Example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/pipeline-authoring/-/issues/30))

1. Select the appropriate checkboxes and share the links to planned features to confirm that the "conversation" has taken place.
