## Intent

This issue describes how broader group and team members are facilitating members of the TW team to take meaningful time away from work.

It allows you to name dynamic backups for specific groups, but you shouldn't expect them to pick up items that can wait, etc. You do that in PTO roots and slack messages as well to an extent, but they are lighter on context and are not as broadly visible.

## :handshake: Responsibilities

List the priorities that the responsible backups need to cover. Backups are fellow Technical Writers.

Responsibilities include reviewing merge requests, responding to documentation-related questions, providing feedback related to UX copy development work, or responding to Slack inquiries.

| Priority | Responsibility | Context link | Primary backup DRI | Secondary backup DRI |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | --------- |
| `HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW` | `e.g. Reviewing merge requests` | `ADD LINK` | `@assignee` | `@assignee` |

## :muscle: Coverage Tasks

Include specific issue links for tasks to be completed by your backups.

- [ ] `Item` - `Link` - `@assignee`

## ðŸš™ Parked tasks

List the larger responsibilities that aren't moving forward until you return, such as re-organizing large pieces of documentation.

- [ ] `Item` - `Link`
