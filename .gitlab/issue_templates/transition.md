## Intro

* [ ]  Existing TW: Invite the trainee to the stage/group Slack channel. Post there letting the team know about the trainee status/milestone, that you're still the go-to for this milestone while they get ramped up (but they will engage on a variety of MRs), and that the trainee is scheduled to be assigned to the specified groups for the subsequent milestone.
* [ ]  Existing TW: Ensure each PM and EM are aware of the changes and ask them for recommendations on meetings the TW should attend, other resources to monitor, on getting to know the stage/group(s) features and any other prerequisite knowledge (perhaps mirroring this aspect of engineer onboarding - e.g. certain videos or tasks within GitLab), and any other suggestions. Enter those details here, in this issue under Further resources or tasks.
