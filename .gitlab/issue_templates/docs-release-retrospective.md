Docs release MR:

## How to add items

Create individual comments for every entry so that each item can have its own thread. Then, each thread will get an `**Action: @mention**` for resolution tracking.

Start your comment with an H2 heading which will be used as its title, and add
the appropriate icon ahead of it to indicate which category it falls under:

- :thumbsup: What went well?
  ```md
  ## :thumbsup: What went well?
  ```
- :thumbsdown: What didn't go well?
  ```md
  ## :thumbsdown: What didn't go well?
  ```
- :bulb: What can we improve?
  ```md
  ## :bulb: What can we improve?
  ```
- :question: Items that are relevant for discussion but not a clear good or bad event to improve upon
  ```md
  ## :question: Items that are relevant for discussion but not a clear good or bad event to improve upon

- :thought_balloon: Items that are related but not required  for closing the retro
  ```md
