Use this template if you want to gain access to the server that hosts the
GitLab Docs [review apps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/review_apps.html).

## New member

- [ ] Add a comment with the **public** SSH key that you will use to log into the server:
      - You can use the one you use for GitLab.com (visit `https://gitlab.com/<username>.keys`).
      - Or you can [create one](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/index.html#generate-an-ssh-key-pair) from scratch.
- [ ] Assign an existing member as a reviewer of this issue. You can ask in `#tw-team` if you need to find a reviewer.
- [ ] Edit `~/.ssh/config` and add the following (pick a username):

      ```
      Host docs-review
        HostName axil-review-app.gitlap.com
        User <username>
        PreferredAuthentications publickey
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<private_key>
      ```

      After your key is added, you can SSH into the server with:

      ```shell
      ssh docs-review
      ```

## Existing member

- [ ] SSH into the server and append the new member's public SSH key into
      `/home/deploy/.ssh/autorized_keys`. Save the file, open a new terminal
      window, and verify you can still SSH into the server.
- [ ] Ping the new member in a comment to let them know that you added their key.
