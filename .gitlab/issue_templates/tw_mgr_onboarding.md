## Technical Writing Manager onboarding

Welcome to the Technical Writing team! As a new GitLab team member, this issue will help you become immersed in your role as a Technical Writing Manager.

### Getting questions answered

If you have questions, don't hesitate to reach out to your UX buddy, your manager, or the Technical Writing team. We have several [Slack channels](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/technical-writing/#slack-channels) you'll want to join and use in your new role.

### Onboarding expectations

Your onboarding doesn't have a scheduled end date. Just focus on getting comfortable with GitLab and getting to know your colleagues.

### Company

GitLab is a special place with a unique culture. We document everything. Most of the information you'll need is available in the [GitLab Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/). We view it as our single source of truth (SSOT).

### Onboarding steps

To complement your general GitLab and manager onboarding issues, completing the following tasks will help with your your Technical Writing Manager duties:

- [ ] Say "hi" to the rest of the Technical Writing team in the #tw-team channel in Slack. Tell us a bit more about yourself by using the [Team Agenda doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XRyVjR5G21Amq4QqJs9jbV0BVQquiBAyPR257-hT1JY/edit), and then during the first team meeting you're able to attend.
- [ ] Read the [Technical Writing Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/technical-writing/).
- [ ] The Technical Writing team uses the Geekbot app in Slack to run asynchronous standups, which include the 'Morning Stretch' and 'Wednesday Weekly' questions. Ask your onboarding buddy who can add you to the application.
- [ ] Submit an access request to become a maintainer for these projects:
   - [`gitlab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab)
   - [`omnibus-gitlab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab)
   - [`charts/gitlab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab)
   - The `gitlab-runner` group [`runner-docs-maintainers`](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/runner-docs-maintainers/-/group_members?sort=access_level_desc).
   - [`gitlab-development-kit`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit) Use the [Single person access request template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/access-requests/issues/new) and tag your manager.
- [ ] Submit an MR to add yourself as a `docs.gitlab.com` administrator to the Google Search Console. Follow the instructions to add an [HTML `meta` tag](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080?hl=en&ref_topic=9455938#zippy=%2Chtml-tag):

  1. Go to <https://search.google.com/search-console>.
  1. In **URL Prefix**, enter `https://docs.gitlab.com` and select **Continue**.
  1. Expand the **HTML Tag** section, and copy the code given.
  1. Open an MR to add the tag and your name to the list at <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/blob/4b87b706ee1f32d2fa25e59d604750ca408f2359/layouts/head.html#L51>.
  1. Submit the MR to your manager for approval and merge.

- [ ] Schedule time with one of the Technical Writers you manage (separate from any introductory or 1:1 meetings) to walk you through the Technical Writing workflow.

### Reference information

Make note of the following reference links and items of information, which may be helpful in your role.

- Useful page links
  - [Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/index.html): The Technical Writing team's style guide for product documentation on <docs.gitlab.com>.
  - [GitLab Documentation guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/index.html): This page (and its subpages) include information for GitLab developers about how to do their work, including how to document their work.
  - [Company writing style guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#writing-style-guidelines): These are good to be aware of, but apply more to general concepts, or for release post work.
  - [GitLab Design System](https://design.gitlab.com/): Also known as Pajamas, this website describes the different elements of design that make up GitLab, including the available UI elements and how to interact with them.
  - [GitLab Release Posts](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/): This page describes the process used for each monthly GitLab milestone release (on the 22nd of each month). The Technical Writing team acts as reviewers for each release post items, and one technical writer (on a [rotating schedule](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/technical-writing/#regularly-scheduled-tasks)) acts as the TW Lead for the release.
  - [Product development flow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/): This is the primary workflow for most of the developer teams. It would be worth reviewing the workflow for those portions that involve Technical Writing.
- Terminology
  - Merge requests: These are also commonly called _pull requests_ in the industry. This is commonly contracted to _MR_.
  - OKRs: [Objectives and Key Results](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/), and these are the primary mechanism GitLab uses to identify and track quarterly improvement goals, both for departments and individuals.
  - TWs: Technical Writers.
- GitLab repository reference. It can be helpful to [star](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/working_with_projects.html#star-a-project) these in GitLab for quick access.
  - <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab>: Create issues or MRs here for documentation and UI text relating to the main GitLab application. Documentation is located in the `/doc` directory.
  - <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/technical-writing>: Create Technical Writing team process issues here.
  - <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs>: Create issues or MRs here that relate to work being done specifically on <docs.gitlab.com> infrastructure (including the front end, back end, and CI, but excluding product documentation content).
  - <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com>: Create issues and MRs here for updating any resource on <about.gitlab.com>, including the GitLab Handbook.
  - <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab>: Create issues or MRs here that are in regards to GitLab Omnibus, the primary installation method for GitLab in self-managed environments.
- Danger checks, which fails pipelines for commit messages that are too long or break other rules, or auto-reply on issues missing certain labels. Rules are defined by the paths [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/Dangerfile), with the code for each rule (each DangerFile) located [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/tree/master/danger).
- GitPod integration - GitPod allows you to run a temporary web environment that includes a running version of GitLab, along with access to the GitLab code repo in a GUI interface. [Doc link](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/gitpod.html#launch-gitpod-in-gitlab)
