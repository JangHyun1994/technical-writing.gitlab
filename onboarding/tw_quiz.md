1. Which GitLab project has the handbook?

1. In the documentation, does GitLab allow use of contractions like "don't" or "can't"?

1. How do you add a new topic to the global nav bar (on the left)?

1. How do you differentiate between features that exist only in certain [tiers](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/tiers/)?

1. Where can you find which stage/group labels to add to an issue/MR, and which technical writer to assign?

1. Which labels must be added to MRs that have changes to the documentation?

1. What is the correct format for linking one doc to another in `gitlab/doc/*`?
