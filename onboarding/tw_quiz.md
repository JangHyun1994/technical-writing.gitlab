These questions are meant to help you get familiar with a variety of documentation.

1. What does the `backstage` label mean?

1. What is Pajamas and who uses it?

1. What are three things the Dangerbot tests for?

1. If you update currently-published content, how often/when is it published to the web?

1. Which GitLab project has instructions for how to run a local build of the docs?

1. How does GitLab handle redirects? (Where is it documented?)

1. Which GitLab project has the handbook?

1. In the documentation, does GitLab use contractions like "don't" or "can't"?

1. How do you add a new topic to the sidebar table of contents?

1. How do you differentiate between topics that are Enterprise Edition only and ones that arenâ€™t?

1. Where can you find which stage/group labels to add to an issue/MR, and which technical writer to assign?

1. Which labels should be added to the majority of documentation MRs?
