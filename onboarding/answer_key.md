### Answers to the research questions

1. What does the `backstage` label mean?

   Use this label for non-user-facing work, such as technical debt, refactoring, etc.

   [Learn more about the labels we use](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/management/throughput/#implementation).

1. What is Pajamas and who uses it?

   The GitLab UI design system for GitLab. It's available at [https://design.gitlab.com/](https://design.gitlab.com/).

1. What are three things the Dangerbot tests for?

   Dangerbot produces warnings and errors when your commit messages don't meet [GitLab commit message guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html#commit-messages-guidelines).

1. If you update currently-published content, how often/when is it published to the web?

   After your merge request pipelines succeed, it can take up to four hours.

   This is explained in the [GitLab /help](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/#gitlab-help) documentation.

1. Which GitLab project has instructions for how to run a local build of the docs?

   [gitlab-docs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs)

1. How does GitLab handle redirects? (Where is it documented?)

   Read more about [changing document location](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/development/documentation/index.html#changing-document-location).

1. Which GitLab project has the handbook?

   [www-gitlab-com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com)

1. In the documentation, does GitLab allow use of contractions like "don't" or "can't"?

   Yes, though there are some cases where you shouldn't.

   In the style guide, read more about [language](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide.html#language).

1. How do you add a new topic to the global nav bar (on the left)?

   Update the [data files](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/tree/master/content/_data). For more information, see [Global navigation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/site_architecture/global_nav.html).

1. How do you differentiate between features that exist only in certain [tiers](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/tiers/)?

   In the documentation, [badges](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide.html#product-badges) are added to features specific to a tier.

   Badges may be listed next to a title (for example, `# Epic Issues API **(ULTIMATE)**`) or inline with content.

1. Where can you find which stage/group labels to add to an issue/MR, and which technical writer to assign?

   For details on who owns what, see [Product stages, groups, and categories](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/).

   For a list of technical writers and their area of responsibility, see [Assignments](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/technical-writing/#assignments).

1. Which labels must be added to MRs that have changes to the documentation?

   See the list of [Documentation labels](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#documentation-labels).

1. What is the correct format for linking one doc to another in `gitlab/doc/*`?

   If the link is in the same project, use a relative link. If it's in the `runner`, `omnibus`, or `chart` projects, use a direct link.

   Learn more about [GitLab preferences for links](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide.html#links).

   Learn more about [the markdown used for links](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#links).

1. When you add suggestions to an MR (by adding a comment and then clicking the **Insert suggestion** button), how do you make suggestions to multiple lines?

   [This content about multi-line suggestions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/discussions/#multi-line-suggestions) should help you understand.
